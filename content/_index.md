    # A description for the paper.
    # description: The Michigan Basin is an intracratonic basin approximately 400 km wide (Howell & van der Pluijm, 1999). It is nearly circular, reaching the largest depth to the cratonic basin sequence in present day Saginaw Bay region. Limited seismology studies have been conducted in Michigan, providing a unique opportunity for this project. This project focuses on new seismological constraints of the crustal structure beneath Michigan using P-to-s receiver functions calculated from the recordings of distant earthquakes at USArray seismometers in Michigan. From receiver functions, we measure variations of the thickness of the crust and sediments within and outside the Michigan Basin. New seismic analyses of the structure of the crust beneath Michigan and surrounding states will help place the Michigan Basin in a broader geologic and tectonic context.

    # A description for the paper.
    # description: Okmok volcano on Umnak Island, Alaska is one of the most hazardous, explosive volcanoes in the Aleutians. Most recently, it erupted in 2008. Previous seismic imaging of Okmokâ€™s large caldera system revealed complex magmatic structures in the upper 5 km beneath the caldera but magma transport at larger depths remains poorly constrained due to reduced imaging resolution. Using receiver function analysis of waveforms, we aim to chart sharp boundaries in the crust beneath Okmok and the surrounding region in order to understand its deeper crustal magmatic system. We have calculated receiver functions for M6 and larger teleseismic earthquakes between 2008 and 2021 recorded by permanent networks AV and AK, and between 2015-2016 at temporary network 5F. We observe Ps arrivals that are consistent with a Moho depth of ~40km, particularly at stations outside the caldera. At some stations, we observe that receiver functions calculated for incoming rays pointing towards the volcano are different from those pointing away from the volcano. However, there is significant variability in the receiver functions, even for overlapping ray paths in the mid-to-deep crust (> 10 km). This suggests complex crustal structure with heterogeneity that may be spatially localized beneath individual stations. Furthermore, receiver functions for stations inside Okmok caldera are more reverberatory than those outside the caldera, indicating that the structure, likely predominantly in the upper crust, beneath these two regions is different.
